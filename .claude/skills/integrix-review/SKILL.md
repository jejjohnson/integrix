description: Review a change or pull request in this repository against its own rules — CODE_REVIEW.md, the contracts in AGENTS.md, reuse of what the package already provides, and numerics (the dtype of weights, pairwise sums, order slopes, stability limits, guarded branches, static shapes). Use when asked to review a diff, branch or PR in this repo.

# Review a change

1. **Get the diff** as `CODE_REVIEW.md` describes, or from the PR. Note which modules, tests and docs it touches.
2. **Reuse** — run the `reuse-reviewer` subagent on the diff: re-written quadrature weights, a hand-rolled sum, scan or stepping loop, or a copied stepper is the main way a package drifts from itself.
3. **Numerics** — run the `numerics-reviewer` subagent in parallel with step 2: the dtype of weights, pairwise sums, order-of-accuracy slopes, stability limits, guarded `where` branches, static shapes under `jit`, reference tolerances, error types and messages, doctest accuracy.
4. **Contracts** — for each module touched, the rules under "The contracts" in `AGENTS.md`: `ValidationError` with `'name' must …` messages at the boundary, no mutated inputs, the input dtype preserved, traceable code with no host RNG and no internal `jax.jit`, rules from functax rather than private copies, the exactness and SciPy gates for every rule and scan, the order slope for every stepper, exceptions deriving from `IntegrixError` and their stdlib base.
5. **Checklist** — the rest of `CODE_REVIEW.md` (public API, API page and `docs/api/index.md` row, capability index, MyST prose, tests and tiers), skipping what ruff, ty or the tests already enforce.
6. **House style** — the `python-style` review checklist if the skill is installed, otherwise "House style" in `AGENTS.md`: docstring layout with a Unicode equation, comments above the line with the equation above each mathematical line, descriptive names, maths in the `eman-style-math` notation, `cyclopts` and `loguru` in new CLIs and scripts.
7. **Verify claims** — for anything you flag as a bug, run it (`uv run python -c "..."`) and report what it printed.

Report in the format `CODE_REVIEW.md` gives (overview, suggestions with priority, file, lines and a concrete change, summary).
